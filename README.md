# Graph Neural Network Battery Data Generation Approach Towards Solving Limited Data Issues

Variables considered- Voltage (V), Charge Capacity (Ah), Battery Level

#### Steps To Follow:

1. The datasets used for this project can be downloaded from github as a zip file.

2. Extract the `datasets` folder from the downloaded zipfile.

3. Upload the extracted folder to google drive. Any new dataset to be used should be uploaded to this `datasets` folder.

4. The code to be executed in google colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/gist/yugendra149/9a999e1065ec08fafae5d001936c0622/execution.ipynb)


5. Make the necessary changes mentioned in the code to get the result.
Hyperparameters can be modified in the `para_la.yaml`.

# Graph Neural Network Battery Data Generation Approach Towards Solving Limited Data Issues

Variables considered- Voltage (V), Charge Capacity (Ah), Battery Level

#### Steps To Follow:

1. upload the code to the google drive.

2. the data is in 'data' folder. Any new dataset to be used should be uploaded to this 'data' folder.

3.The code to be executed in google colab: [![Open In Colab]   (https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]     (https://colab.research.google.com/github/yugendra149/ARTIFICIAL-DATA-CREATION/blob/main/EXECUTION.ipynb)

4.link the drive and colab.

5. convert the excle or csv data file to .h5 data file by extracting only desired features .

6. prepare the data for training.

7. train the model.

8. extract the predicted value and measure the error between true and predicted values.

9. Make the necessary changes mentioned in the code to get the result.

10.Hyperparameters can be modified in the `para_la.yaml`.
